### Step 5

Clicking on the url shown above, you can view the repository created for your individual assignment.

### Step 6

This view of GitHub Classroom is available for Dr. Timmer but not the students. Notice at this point, only one student has accepted the assignment, Dr. Timmer. It also shows that Dr. Timmer  has accepted the assignment but not submitted the assignment.

The reason this screen is shown is to inform students that Dr. Timmer can check the status of your assignment.

### Step 7

The screenshot show below displays Dr. Timmer's individual repository for Lab Five. Students get to this screen by clicking the URL shown in Step Four. The first step in copying the URL of the assignment URL is to click on the Code button circled in the red ellipse.

### Step 8

After clicking on the Code button in Step 7, click on the copy icon circled in the red ellipse.

### Step 9

The portion of completing the assignment is to start the GitHub Desktop application. In Dr. Timmer's case, it is a matter of clicking on the GitHub Desktop icon.

### Step 10

After double-clicking on the GitHub Desktop icon, GitHub Desktop will start showing the previously used repository within GitHub Desktop. The next portion is to clone the repository from the utrgvqualityengineering organization to your local machine where the lab can be completed. To begin the process of cloning the repository to the local machine, click on File.

### Step 11

After clicking on File, click on the Clone repository option shown in the red ellipse.

### Step 12

After clicking on Clone a repository, the following screen will appear. To clone the repository, we will use the URL Option shown in the red ellipse.

![](images/LabFiveGD4.png)

### Step 13

After clicking on the URL, the URL for the repository should be entered in the top text area. As a reminder, the URL was copied to the clipboard in Step 8. To enter the URL, right-click and paste within the top text area. 

It is very helpful to note the Local path which is the location on your computer where the repository is stored. Eventually we will need this information.

### Step 14

The screenshot shown below is for the local repository. Once it is cloned, there are no local changes yet because the repository has not been processed.

### Step 15

Dr. Timmer is demonstrating using a Windows laptop. The first step is to start an Anaconda Prompt for Windows. Mac Users would open a terminal.

### Step 16

The Anaconda Prompt window is shown below the next task is to change directory (cd) to the location of the repository (Local Path from Step 13).

![](images/LabFiveDOS2.png)

### Step 17

The change directory command to switch to the location of the repository is shown below. To execute the command, enter must be inputted.

![](images/LabFiveDOS3.png)

### Step 18

To see the contents of the local directory in Windows use the dir command. Mac-users would use the ls command.

![](images/LabFiveDOS4.png)

### Step 19

To start Jupyter Notebook, use the command jupyter notebook. The text from the Jupyter Notebook server is shown in the Anaconda prompt. In Dr. Timmer's configuration, a browser running Jupyter Notebook automatically appears.

### Step 20

Notice that there are two files in the directory from which Jupyter Notebook started. The gitHubExample.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook file for Lab 5. Double-click on the circled file name to view the  Jupyter Notebook.

![](images/LabFiveJupyter1.png)

### Step 21

The Jupyter Notebook contains two cell. The top cell contains Markdown describing the assignment. The lower cell is a code cell and will be used to do programming in future labs.  To edit the Markdown code in the top cell, double-click anywhere in the top cell.

### Step 22

After double-clicking in the Markdown cell, the Markdown code will be displayed. Replace the text "Your Name" with your name.

### Step 23

To save the changes, click on the disk icon in the red circle.

![](images/LabFiveJupyter4.png)

### Step 24

After saving your changes in the Jupyter Notebook application, switch back to the GitHub Desktop. Notice that two files have been changed. So the local version is not the same as the classroom version stored in utrgvqualityengineering organization for this lab.

![](images/LabFiveGD10.png)

### Step 25

Notice that the text First Attempt has been added and a description of "My first attempt at lab 5." After entering the text click on "Commit to main". Uploading your local copy is a two-step process and committing is the first step.

![](images/LabFiveGD11.png)

### Step 26

The final step is to push the local repository to the version stored in utrgvqualityengineering.

![](images/LabFiveGD12.png)

### Step 27

Notice that GitHub Desktop shows "No local changes". This screen is identical to the one shown in Step 14. This indicates the repository stored locally and in utrgvqualityengineering are identical. In summary, the changes have been uploaded to the classroom copy.

### Step 28

After completing the process of committing and pushing the repository to the utrgvqualityengineering repository, Dr. Timmer's view of the GitHub Classroom change the status from "Not submitted" to "Submitted".

![](images/LabFiveClassroom10.png)

### Step 29

Dr. Timmer can click on the Repository link to view what was submitted.

![](images/LabFiveClassroom11.png)

### Step 30

Dr. Timmer can view your submission by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook. It is strongly recommended that every student check with Dr. Timmer after submitting to ensure the assignment was recevied and correct.
